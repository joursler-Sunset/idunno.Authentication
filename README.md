# idunno.Authentication.Basic

This project contains an implementation of [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#section-11) for ASP.NET Core. 

It is meant as a demonstration of how to write authentication middleware and **not** as something you would seriously consider using.

## How do I use this?

First acquire an HTTPS certificate (see Notes below). Apply it to your website. Remember to renew it in two years.

Remember this is meant as a demonstration on how to write middleware. Yes, this could be easier, 
I could put a package on nuget, but **it's not meant to be for use in production**.

In your web application add a reference to the package, then in the `Configure` method in `startup.cs` call
`app.UseBasicAuthentication()`, providing a delegate for `OnValidateCredentials` to validate any 
user name and password sent with requests and turn that information into an AuthenticationTicket, set it
on the `context.AuthenticationTicket` property and call `context.HandleResponse()`.

You can also specify the Realm used to isolate areas of a web site from one another.

For example;

```c#
app.UseBasicAuthentication(options => 
{
    options.Realm = "idunno";
    options.Events = new BasicAuthenticationEvents
    {
        OnValidateCredentials = context =>
        {
            if (context.Username == context.Password)
            {
                var claims = new[]
                {
                    new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, context.Username)
                };

                context.AuthenticationTicket = new AuthenticationTicket(
                    new ClaimsPrincipal(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Options.AuthenticationScheme)),
                    new AuthenticationProperties(), context.Options.AuthenticationScheme);

                context.HandleResponse();
             }

             return Task.FromResult<object>(null);
         }
     };
});
```

In the sample you can see that the delegate checks if the user name and password are identical. If they
are then it will consider that a valid login, create claims from the ticket, then create an
`Authentication` ticket containing a principal which contains the claims, then tell ASP.NET Core it 
has handled the authentication request.

Of course you'd never implement such a simple validator would you? No? Good. Have a cookie.

### Notes

Basic Authentication sends credentials unencrypted. You should only use it over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). 

It may also have performance impacts, credentials are sent and validated with every request. As you should not be storing passwords in clear text your validation procedure will have to hash and compare values
with every request, or cache results of previous hashes (which could lead to data leakage). 

Remember that hash comparisons should be time consistent to avoid [timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack).
